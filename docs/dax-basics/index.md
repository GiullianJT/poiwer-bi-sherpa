# 🧮 DAX Basics

> **Goal:** Walk away able to write clear, performant DAX for day-to-day reporting  
> and know when *not* to write DAX at all.

---

## 📋 What you’ll learn

1. **Measures** – why they beat calculated columns nine times out of ten.  
2. **Core Functions** – aggregators, iterators, counters, logical tricks.  
3. **Evaluation Contexts** – filter vs. row context, plus the magic of `CALCULATE`.  
4. **Time Intelligence** – YTD, rolling windows, and common gotchas.  

Each module comes with hands-on labs that mirror real business problems.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* Basic Power BI Desktop navigation.  
* A clean star-schema model (or the sample file we provide).  
* Willingness to break bad Excel habits.

If your data model is still a snowflake nightmare, **fix it first**—DAX can’t save a rotten schema.
